The @Value annotation is used to inject values into fields in Spring applications. Here are the usage examples:

Injecting a string value directly from the annotation to the field:
@Value("string value")
private String stringValue;

Injecting a value from a properties file:


@Value("${value.from.file}")
private String valueFromFile;

Injecting a value from a system property:


@Value("${systemValue}")
private String systemValue;


Providing default values for properties that might not be defined:


@Value("${unknown.param:some default}")
private String someDefault;


Injecting a value that is defined as both a system property and in the properties file:


@Value("${priority}")
private String prioritySystemProperty;


Injecting multiple values as an array, with the values defined as comma-separated values in the properties file:


@Value("${listOfValues}")
private String[] valuesArray;


In Java, DriverManager is a class that manages a list of database drivers. It provides a facility to register and unregister JDBC drivers. JDBC drivers are used by applications to connect to a database. When a new driver is registered with the DriverManager, it is added to the list of drivers that the DriverManager knows about, and it can be used to connect to the database.

DriverManager provides several methods for managing the list of drivers, including:

registerDriver(Driver driver): Registers a new JDBC driver with the DriverManager.
getDriver(String url): Returns the JDBC driver that can be used to connect to the specified URL.
getConnection(String url, String user, String password): Returns a connection to the database specified by the URL, username, and password.
Applications typically use the DriverManager to obtain a connection to a database, using the getConnection() method. The application provides the JDBC URL, username, and password to the getConnection() method, and DriverManager returns a Connection object that can be used to execute SQL statements against the database.
